# SQL Injection

## Entry point detection

For every request we intercept, one of the GET param or POST data could be vulnerable to SQL injection, so, How can we know if it is.


### 1. Break the query 
```
[Nothing]
'       ''      %27
"       ""      %22
`       ``
#       ##      %23
;       ;;      %3B
*       ** 
/       //
\       \\


')
")
`)
'))
"))
`))

' or "
-- or # 
' OR '1
' OR 1 -- -
" OR "" = "
" OR 1 = 1 -- -
' OR '' = '
```

if you get an `error`, then it's vulnerable.

### 2. Bypass the query 

#### Using WHERE

```

```


#### USing LIKE
