# Recon / Scannning / Information Gathering

Collecting host metadata about services and users, Checking informations about a domain, IP address, phone number or an email address.

## Automation tools 
Recon- NG

### spidering tool ==> Running Burp Spider
### vulnerability scanners 
### brute forcing tool 
### site map ==> Site map in Burp Suite Or ZAP 




## Whois

```bash
$ ping <IP>

$ whois <IP>
```
<!-- # Enhanced Whois

# Get ASN for your target

## Mapping The App & Network

### Nmap 


<!-- ### Nessus:
Nessus is a commercial vulnerability scanner. Its purpose is to identify vulnerable applications running on a system and provides a variety of details about potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. Nessus is a paid product, but the comprehensive information that it provides can make it a worthwhile investment for a hacker. -->


### Nikto : 
Nikto is a web server vulnerability scanner that can be used for reconnaissance in a manner similar to Nessus and OpenVAS. It can detect a variety of different vulnerabilities but is also not a stealthy scanner. Scanning with Nikto can be effective but is easily detectable by an intrusion detection or prevention system (like most active reconnaissance tools).

### Metasploit \ Searchsploit :  
Metasploit is primarily designed as an exploitation toolkit. It contains a variety of different modules that have prepackaged exploits for a number of vulnerabilities. With Metasploit, even a novice hacker has the potential to break into a wide range of vulnerable machines.

Although it was designed as an exploit toolkit, Metasploit can also be effectively used for reconnaissance. At the minimum, using the autopwn option on Metasploit allows a hacker to try to exploit a target using any means necessary. More targeted analysis can allow a hacker to perform reconnaissance using Metasploit with more subtlety.

## Having Proxy Listener

MITM, Burp, ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) 

Inspecting HTTP headers, HTTP cookies, and URL query strings

Tracking URL and POST body parameters to see how the application interacts with the database



## Architecture Information

Discovering what languages or content management systems (CMS) is running in the backend.

## Scrapping & Investigation

==> Web Scraping  ===> scrapy tool !!!  OctoParse  is strong too

Handling Anti-Scraping Mechanisms: There are websites on the Internet that have anti-scraping measures in place. If you are afraid you’ve hit a wall with this, these measures can be bypassed through simple modifications to the crawler. Pick a web crawler that comes in handy in overcoming these roadblocks with a robust mechanism of its own.

```note
take a glance on the page source.
```

#### For Every Page !! 


- get all the comment in html/css/js 
- get all href 
- heddin inputs

#### Listing all input vectors that potentially talk to the back end
#### Locating data entry points 

Perhaps, the most common guidance is to “fully understand how the application behaves”

(HTML input fields such as forms fields, hidden fields, drop-down boxes, and radio button lists)

URL parameters 
Forms inputs 



Performing client-side HTML and JavaScript functionality review


Identifying the encoding scheme(s) used





```note
Tips

# Fuzz non-printable characters in any user input
# Could result in regex bypass, account takeover...
0x00, 0x2F, 0x3A, 0x40, 0x5B, 0x60, 0x7B, 0xFF
%00, %2F, %3A, %40, %5B, %60, %7B, %FF
```

### DVCS-Ripper

Distributed Version Control System, 

Web applications are not developed over night. Developers use all sorts of version control systems (VCS) to keep a centralized source for their application’s code base. However when a developer clones their repository into their new web server, hidden directories related to their VCS is created to keep track of updates, new commits and configuration settings. Since these hidden directories are often under the same directory where the application is running, these directories are publicly accessible over the web.

DVCS-Ripper is a suite of tools developed in perl that can discover and download web accessible version control systems, including GIT, SVN, Mercurial and more. DVCS-Ripper will crawl this structure and download all the files found. Repository names, usernames, and even source code can all be fetched from these hidden directories facilitating the total compromise of an application.
