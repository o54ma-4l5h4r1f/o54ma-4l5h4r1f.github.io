# JNDI injection & LDAP Entry Poisoning 

## Introduction
> JNDI is a NutShell

`Java Naming and Directory Interface`, is a common interface to interact with Naming and Directory Services/Providers.


### # What is Naming Service/Provider 
is a system that `Binds` a name to a given value/object.

It provides a facility to find an object based on a name that is known as `Lookup` or `Search` operation.

```note
EX : DNS Naming Service, that Binds the IP adddress to the host name 

EX : File System Naming Service, that binds the file name to the file itself   
```

### # What is Directory Service/Provider
is a service that allows `Storing` and `finding` special type of objects that is known as Directory Object -- A collection of attributes --

thereore it offers extended functionality to operate on the object attributes. 

```note
EX : LDAP Directory Service, that stores things like employee records with all the collection of attributes (name, email, location, ...)  
```
