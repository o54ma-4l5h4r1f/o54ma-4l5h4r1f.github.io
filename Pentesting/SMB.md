## Port 139
This port is used for NetBIOS. 

> `NetBIOS` is an acronym for Network Basic Input/OutputSystem. It allows applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. `Asstrictly an API`, NetBIOS is `not` a networking protocol. NetBIOS normally runs over TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (`NBT`) protocol. This results in each computer in the network having both an IP address and a `NetBIOS name` corresponding to a (possibly different) `host name`. Simply saying, it is a protocol that allows communication of files and printers through the Session Layer of the OSI Model in a LAN.
