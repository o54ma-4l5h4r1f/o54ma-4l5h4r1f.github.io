# 1. Enumeration & Kernel Exploits
 
## Automated Tools

* [linux-smart-enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration)
	```bash
	$ ./lse.sh -l1 # shows interesting information that should help you to privesc
	$ ./lse.sh -l2 # dump all the information it gathers about the system
	```
* [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)
	```bash
	$ ./linpeas.sh -a # all checks - deeper system enumeration, but it takes longer to complete.
	$ ./linpeas.sh -s # superfast & stealth - This will bypass some time consuming checks. In stealth mode Nothing will be written to the disk.
	$ ./linpeas.sh -P # Password - Pass a password that will be used with sudo -l and bruteforcing other users
	```
* [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)
	```bash
	$ ./LinEnum.sh -s -k keyword -r report -e /tmp/ -t
	```

```warning
Don't use kernel exploits if you can avoid it. If you use it it might crash the machine or put it in an unstable state. 

Always use a simpler priv-esc if you can. They can also produce a lot of stuff in the sys.log. So if you find anything good, put it up on your list and keep searching for other ways before exploiting it.
