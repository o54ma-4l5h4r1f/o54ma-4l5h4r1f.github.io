Hi, I am <span> [Osama Alsharif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osama-alsharif-21153716a) </span> :wave: . I am making this blog as a reference resource for people who are interested in cyber security.


The topics covered in this blog are a reflection of my educational and practical experience, and are designed to serve as a quick, concise, and self-explanatory resource for those interested in cybersecurity. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting out, I hope that my blog provides you with valuable information and insights.


The idea for this blog came from my desire to document what I have learned, as well as my belief that teaching others is the best way to reinforce and deepen one's own understanding of a subject. I want to use this platform as my personal scratch pad, a place where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and expertise with the world.

So, whether you're here to learn something new, or just to see what I have to say, I hope that you find this blog to be a valuable resource. Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to connecting with you!
